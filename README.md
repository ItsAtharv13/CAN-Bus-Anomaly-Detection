CAN Bus Data Analysis for Anomaly Detection
An AI-powered system to detect anomalies and intrusions in automotive Controller Area Network (CAN) bus data using machine learning. This project aims to provide a robust solution for enhancing vehicle security and reliability.

About The Project
Modern vehicles are complex networks on wheels, with dozens of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) communicating over the CAN bus. While this enables advanced features, it also introduces vulnerabilities. An unauthorized message on the bus could potentially control critical functions like brakes or steering.

This project tackles this challenge by:

Analyzing real-world CAN bus traffic to understand normal communication patterns.

Developing an unsupervised machine learning model to detect anomalies and potential intrusions in real-time.

Providing a framework for vehicle health monitoring and cybersecurity research.

Tech Stack
Python: The core language for data analysis and model development.

Pandas & NumPy: For efficient data manipulation and numerical operations.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and creating insightful plots.

Scikit-learn: For implementing the machine learning models (e.g., Isolation Forest).

JupyterLab: For interactive development and exploratory data analysis.

Project Roadmap
